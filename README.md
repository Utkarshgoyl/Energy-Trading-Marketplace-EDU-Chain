# 🔌 Energy Trading Marketplace

## 📖 Project Description

The Energy Trading Marketplace is a decentralized platform that allows users to trade energy in a peer-to-peer fashion using smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. By enabling producers and consumers to interact directly, the platform promotes transparency, efficiency, and sustainability in energy distribution.

## 🌍 Project Vision

To decentralize and democratize the energy market by removing intermediaries and enabling individuals and communities to produce, trade, and consume renewable energy in a secure and trustless environment.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **User Registration**: Roles for both energy producers and consumers.
- **Energy Deposit**: Producers can deposit energy units to the system.
- **Fund Deposit & Withdrawal**: Consumers and producers can manage their wallet balances in the contract.
- **Energy Trade Creation**: Producers can create energy offers specifying energy amounts and price per unit.
- **Trade Execution**: Consumers can accept and pay for energy trades directly on-chain.
- **Data Transparency**: On-chain tracking of users, trades, balances, and trade status.

## 🔮 Future Scope

- **Dynamic Pricing Mechanism**: Implement demand-based dynamic pricing using oracles.
- **Integration with IoT Devices**: Automate real-time energy tracking via smart meters.
- **Reputation System**: Introduce ratings for reliable producers/consumers.
- **Green Certificate Tokenization**: Issue NFTs or ERC-20 tokens as proof of renewable energy usage.
- **Multi-Chain Deployment**: Extend support to other blockchains like Polygon or Binance Smart Chain.
